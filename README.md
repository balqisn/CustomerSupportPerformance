# Summary :
- Email channel has an average CSAT score of 3.9 with an average response time of 172.92 minutes, which is higher compared to other channels, even though the total number of issues is lower. Morning-shift agents for email tend to have longer first response times, especially for those with tenure >90 days (209.65 minutes). On-the-job training (OJT) agents, however, respond faster at 183.98 minutes. The majority of issues in this channel are related to installation/demo.
- Inbound channel shows a relatively stable CSAT score, first response time, and shift distribution. Although there are occasional dips in CSAT, it remains around 4.0, indicating consistent service quality.
- Outcall channel records an average CSAT score of 4.3, but on August 13 (split shift), it dropped significantly to 2.2, coinciding with an unusually high average handling time of 3,190 minutes. The handling time spike in Outcall is mainly driven by return request cases, which are typically harder to resolve because customers require more detailed guidance and multiple follow-ups. This suggests that the root cause is not only workload distribution, but also the complexity of educating customers during return processes.

# Action insight :
- Provide refresher training and procedure updates for email agents with tenure >90 days to strengthen response efficiency and overall service quality.
- Implement shift distribution optimization based on tenure and skill level to balance workload and maintain service performance.
- Conduct a review of handling procedures for high-volume issues such as delayed orders and return requests to improve average handling time and safeguard customer satisfaction.
- Monitor anomalies in split shifts, such as the August 13 outcall case, to quickly identify root causes and prevent repeated service quality drops.
- Launch improvement initiatives focusing on standardized return-handling scripts, enhanced customer education materials, and potentially a dedicated return-handling team to reduce resolution time.
